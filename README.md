# STATGU4241-5241-Project
Project for Spring 2021 Columbia Statistical Machine Learning Class GU 4241/5241

## File Directories
* **Data** contains the dataset used for the project
* **Codes**
  - Do **not** make direct changes to the main file: use branches to avoid merge conflicts and make `pull requests` to merge to the `main branch`
  - Recommend using Visual Studio Code to easily connect with GitHub and use Git version control than Jupyter Notebook

## Environment set up for Visual Studio Code
VS Code is a powerful code editor with extensions of different languages.
It has built-in Git commands that make it easier to stage and commit.
